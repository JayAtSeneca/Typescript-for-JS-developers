# Typescript-for-JS-developers

TypeScript is a programming language that is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, adding optional static typing and class-based object-oriented programming to the language. It is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. TypeScript can be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution. Some of the features of TypeScript include interfaces, classes, and static typing, which can help improve the structure and maintainability of your code. TypeScript is particularly useful for developers who are working on projects with a large codebase, or who want to take advantage of the latest language features supported by modern JavaScript. If you are a JavaScript developer looking to use TypeScript in your projects, this repository is a great resource for learning more about the language and getting started with it.
